# Evelyn Eidsath's Portfolio

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio website to display work samples for the reference of prospective employers.

A portfolio is a convenient location to summarize your work experience and history, as well as to share information about yourself that employers might find useful to know. The portfolio is meant to have a clear layout and navigation bar to make it easy for employers to view an individual's personal information, professional work examples, and contact information. This makes the portfolio an ideal reference to use during job searches and networking.

By making this portfolio, I became familiar with the processs of creating a website from scratch. I was able to address the code step-by-step, starting with a wireframe, then establishing the content of the site with HTML, and finally styling each section with CSS. I also learned how to use pseudo-classes to create engaging effects for users. Finally, I became far more acquainted with how flexbox is used to arrange a dynamic layout for various screen sizes.
