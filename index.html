                <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio. This website as well as all the projects linked here are examples of my web design experience. I starting learning to code in HTML and CSS last year, and I am currently taking a course to become certified in full-stack web development. The languages I am currently studying include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I will continue updating this portfolio as I gain more experience, learn new coding languages, and create new projects.<br><br>
                Here's a little background about myself. I graduated from UC Davis in 2020 with a Bachelor of Science in Food Science. From 2018 to 2021, I worked as a lab technician in a research lab owned by the USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS), where I maintained insect colonies for pesticide testing. After that, I worked as a Quality Assurance Technician for Kerry Taste & Nutrition, and later in the same role for a Safeway-owned dairy processing plant. In those roles I performed many analytical tests, prepared microbiological incubations, and processed large amounts of data in laboratory information management system (LIMS) softwares. While these positions may not be directly related to coding and web development, they gave me invaluable experience that greatly improved my skills in decision-making, time management, communication, and teamwork, which are all vital to any successful career.<br><br>
                Please take a look at my projects below, and reach out to me using the contacts listed at the bottom of the page.
